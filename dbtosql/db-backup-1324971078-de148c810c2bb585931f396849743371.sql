In November, 61-year-old Amphon Tangnoppakul was sentenced to 20 years in jail for sending four text messages deemed offensive to the crown.\n\nGordon posted links the to banned biography of King Bhumibol Adulyadej several years ago while living in the U.S. state of Colorado, and his case has raised questions about the applicability of Thai law to acts committed by foreigners outside Thailand.\n\nSpeaking after the verdict, Gordon said, \"I am an American citizen, and what happened was in America.\"\n\nHe also said he had no expectation of being let off easy. \"This is just the system in Thailand,\" he said. Speaking later in Thai, he added: \"In Thailand, they put people in prison even if they don\'t have proof.\"\n\nGordon had lived in the U.S. for about 30 years. He was detained in late May during a visit to his native country to seek treatment for arthritis and high blood pressure. After being repeatedly denied bail, he pleaded guilty in October in hopes of obtaining a lenient sentence.\n\nThailand\'s lese majeste laws are the harshest in the world. They mandate that people found guilty of defaming the monarchy -- including the king, the queen and the heir to the throne -- face three to 15 years behind bars.
